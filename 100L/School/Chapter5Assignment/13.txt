 Write statements that assign random integers to the variable n in the following ranges:
a) 1 ≤ n ≤ 6
answer: int n = (rand() % 6) + 1;
b) 100 ≤ n ≤ 1000
answer: int n = (rand() % 1000) + 100;
c) 0 ≤ n ≤ 19
answer: int n = (rand() % 20);
d) 1000 ≤ n ≤ 2222
answer: int n = (rand() % 2223) + 1000;
e) –1 ≤ n ≤ 1
answer: int n = (rand() % 3) - 1;
f) –3 ≤ n ≤ 11
answer: int n = (rand() % 15) - 3;
